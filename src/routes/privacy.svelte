<h1>Privacy</h1>
<h2>What we store</h2>
<p>
	When you create an account with there's care, we request an e-mail (to verify you are human and to
	activate your account) and a password. We will then, after activation, provide you with a moniker
	which will be used to identify you anywhere on the site. This moniker is randomly generated,
	cannot be set manually, and can only be regenerated every week. This enforces our ideology of
	anonymous communication. The most we store is your user ID, your moniker, and your e-mail address.
	IP addresses are logged, however they cannot be tied to an individual user and are used for
	anti-abuse purposes.
</p>
<h2>Chat</h2>
<p>
	there's care has an anonymous chat feature. This chat system is moderated. Chat logs are kept for
	24 hours from any chat room, public or private, for moderation purposes. The only identifier we
	have is your user account moniker which, as previously stated, is randomy generated. Moderators
	can be identified with a üõ°Ô∏è shield tag, however this tag can be turned off.
</p>
<h2>Legal</h2>
<p>
	In the event that we are requested to turn over information to authorities, we will provide a
	platform-wide announcement as soon as possible disclosing what was requested, but in the
	announcement we will not disclose what users were part of an investigation.
